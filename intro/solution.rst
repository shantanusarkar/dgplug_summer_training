About #dgplug Summer Training
------------------------------
I came to know about this training from my college seniors and decided to attend this training this year. I have been attending this training for around 3 weeks now, and it is great. Till now I have learnt :

- Communication in FOSS
- Familiarization with linux and its basic commands
- File Hierarchy Standard
- vim and its commands
- Version Control Systems, like git
- Restructured Text
- Programming with Python

Still a major part of the training is left. The training is mentored by `Kushal Das`_. This Training is going to be very useful for me and I am thankful to Kushal for that. Training is going on and there is a long summer to go.
